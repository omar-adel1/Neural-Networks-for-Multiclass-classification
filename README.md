# Neural-Networks-for-Multiclass-classification

This repository contains the implementation of the softmax function and a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using a subset of the MNIST dataset. This work is part of a practical lab assignment for the **"Advanced Learning Algorithms"** course by **Andrew Ng**, hosted on **Coursera** as part of the **Machine Learning Specialization**.

## Contents
- Softmax function implementation
- Simple neural network for digit classification

## Dataset
The dataset consists of handwritten digit images (0-9), similar to the MNIST dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework used)

## Usage
Run the notebook or scripts to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The model achieves a decent accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.
